# Experimentation 101
Think of this as your survival guide for running experiments without constantly questioning your life choices. Whether you're just starting out or fine-tuning your approach, this repo will help you design, analyze, and interpret experiments with (mostly) unshakable confidence.<br><br>
I'll keep adding new methods and insights, so you can spend less time overthinking p-values and more time actually learning something useful.<br><br>
Cheers :")
